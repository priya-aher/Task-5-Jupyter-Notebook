# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Internship Task 5 - Data Analyst Internship

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle's "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition.

The objective of this task is to extract meaningful insights using statistical summaries and data visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand dataset structure
- Handle missing values
- Identify patterns and trends
- Analyze relationships between features
- Extract insights affecting passenger survival

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

- Source: Kaggle – Titanic Dataset
- Total Records: 891
- Total Features: 12
- Target Variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## 🔎 Data Cleaning Steps

- Filled missing values in Age using median
- Filled missing values in Embarked using mode
- Dropped Cabin column due to excessive missing values

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Performed

### ✔ Univariate Analysis
- Survival Distribution
- Gender Distribution
- Age Distribution
- Passenger Class Distribution

### ✔ Bivariate Analysis
- Survival vs Gender
- Survival vs Passenger Class
- Survival vs Age
- Survival vs Fare

### ✔ Correlation Analysis
- Heatmap visualization
- Pairplot analysis

### ✔ Feature Engineering
- Created new feature: FamilySize

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Females had significantly higher survival rates.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Higher fare increased survival probability.
- 3rd class passengers had the lowest survival rate.
- Socio-economic factors influenced survival outcomes.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

EDA helped uncover meaningful patterns and relationships affecting passenger survival. The insights gained can be useful for building predictive machine learning models.
